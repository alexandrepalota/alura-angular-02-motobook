# Motobook

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Creating a module with route

Run `ng generate module home --routing`. This will create a new module named home.

To check if the paths and files names will be as intended, run the same command above, adding a `-d` parameter. This will create the module without really maka any changes. Then, if everything is ok, run the command without `-d`.
